                             OPENAIR-CN
    An implementation of the Evolved Packet Core network.
    
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
  Openair-cn is an implementation of the 3GPP specifications concerning the 
  Evolved Packet Core Networks, that means it contains the implementation of the
  following network elements:

  * MME,
  * HSS,
  * S-GW+P-GW.
  
  Each element implementation has its own repository: this repository (`openair-spgwc`) is meant for SPGW-C.

# openair-spgwc

Control User Plane Separation of SPGW-C and SPGW-U, SPGW-C implementation is available in this repo.
