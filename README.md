  Openair-cn is an implementation of the 3GPP specifications concerning the 
  Evolved Packet Core Networks, that means it contains the implementation of the
  following network elements:

  * MME,
  * HSS,
  * S-GW+P-GW.
  
  Each element implementation has its own repository: this repository (`openair-spgwc`) is meant for SPGW-C.

# openair-spgwc

In the `Control / User Planes Separation` (a.k.a. `CUPS`) of SPGW, only the SPGW-C (Control Plane) implementation is available in this repo.

It is distributed under `OAI Public License V1.1`. See [OAI Website for more details](https://www.openairinterface.org/?page_id=698).

The text for `OAI Public License V1.1` is also available under [LICENSE](LICENSE) file in the same directory.

# Where to start

  The Openair-cn SPGW-C code is written, executed, and tested on `UBUNTU` server `bionic` version.

  It is also built and tested on `RHEL8` platform (such as `Openshift`).

  More details on the deployment options and the supported feature set is available on this [page](docs/FEATURE_SET.md).
