# 1. PGW Fundamentals #

(from [Wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Architecture_Evolution))

The Packet Data Network Gateway provides connectivity from the UE to external packet data networks by being the point of exit and entry of traffic for the UE.

A UE may have simultaneous connectivity with more than one PGW for accessing multiple PDNs.

The PGW performs:

-  Policy enforcement,
-  Packet filtering for each user,
-  Charging support,
-  Lawful interception and
-  Packet screening.

Another key role of the PGW is to act as the anchor for mobility between 3GPP and non-3GPP technologies such as WiMAX and 3GPP2 (CDMA 1X and EvDO)
