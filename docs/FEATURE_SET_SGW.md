# 1. SGW Fundamentals #

(from [Wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Architecture_Evolution))

The Serving Gateway routes and forwards user data packets, while also acting as the mobility anchor for the user plane during inter-eNodeB handovers and as the anchor for mobility between LTE and other 3GPP technologies (terminating S4 interface and relaying the traffic between 2G/3G systems and PGW).

For idle state UEs, the SGW terminates the downlink data path and triggers paging when downlink data arrives for the UE.

*  It manages and stores UE contexts, e.g. parameters of the IP bearer service, network internal routing information.
*  It also performs replication of the user traffic in case of lawful interception.
